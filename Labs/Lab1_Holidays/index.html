                                        <h2>Overview / Logistics</h2>
										<p>
                                            The purpose of this lab is for you to brush up on your knowledge of methods and how they fit together while you also get some experience with C++ and makefiles.  You will be converting data from one format (parallel arrays) to another format (HTML).  Though it is often tedious, automating such data conversions is a common task in software engineering, so this is a valuable skill.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Furthermore, you will get experience making <b>code that writes code!</b>.  This is also a common task, as we might have a higher level language with more context (like C++ in our example) that writes tons of code in a simpler language (assembly language) that would be very tedious to write out by hand.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Compared to 173, you will notice that the design of your methods is left a little bit more up to you.  This is intentional.  Students are moving more towards autonomy in their design in this course, so you should spend a little bit more time up front sketching out a plan on a piece of paper before you start coding.  Of course, I am also happy to discuss your ideas!  But just be sure to <b>think before you code</b>.
                                        </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Modern web pages are formatted in a scripting language known as <a href = "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Hypertext Markup Language</a>, or HTML for short.  This code can be written up front and fixed for static web pages (like the one you're looking at now), but we very often want to generate it programmatically so we don't have to write it from scratch every time a small amount of data changes.  This is the basis of server-side web languages such as <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a>.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Every type of formatting occurs in what's known as a "tag."  The web site w3schools.com has some <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">nice tutorials on different HTML tags</a>, but we will be just focusing on one set of tags today for <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp">HTML tables</a>.  <b>You do not need any prior HTML language to do this lab</b>.  Just follow the rules I'm giving you here.  You can read more about them at <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp">this link</a>, but the example covers everything you need to know for this lab.  In particular,
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                Every table tag begins with <code>&lttable&gt</code> and ends with <code>&lt/table&gt</code>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Within the table, every row tag begins with <code>&lttr&gt</code> and ends with <code>&lt/tr&gt</code>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Within each row, every column tag begins with <code>&lttd&gt</code> and ends with <code>&lt/td&gt</code>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                The data for the table goes within the <code>&lttd&gt ... &lt/td&gt</code> tags.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                        You should also create a helper method in <code>dateutils.cpp</code> and <code>dateutils.h</code> that converts a month number into a string representing that month.  <b>HINT:</b> Your code will be much shorter if you use an array to store and reference the month names instead of having a bunch of if statements or a switch statement.
                                    </p>


                                    <h3>Running the code</h3>
                                    <p>

                                    Here are a few things you can do that are above and beyond
                                    <ul>

                                            If all of the tags are there, the HTML will work properly, even if there is no whitespace in between the tags.  But the code will be a big mess.  Format the HTML code nicely with line breaks and tabs where appropriate
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Stylize your table using <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp">CSS</a>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                        The easiest place to start would be to define the first method that takes in a number for the month and prints a string corresponding to that month.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <b>Note also:</b> To get your program to do anything, you'll have to have statements in the main.  By themselves, the functions may work perfectly, but if you don't have code that runs in the main that eventually calls them, nothing will happen when you run your code.
                                    </p>
