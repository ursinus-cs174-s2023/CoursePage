                        As we've discussed an experienced, it's possible to write code that works, but which is completely unreadable and difficult to debug as a result.  Furthermore, we want to get you into the habit of writing good code that is easy for others to read and which is hence <i>easier to maintain</i>.  In practice, if people can't read your code, they'll just do it over from scratch their own way.  It would be a shame for all of your hard work to go to waste!  
                    <p>
                        Below are some rules to help keep you on the rails as you design (they have been adapted from <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/133-ann-marie-v-schilling">Professor Schilling</a>).  On many assignments, a portion of the grade will depend on adhering to these rules
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            The main method should be kept as a staging area for other code (e.g. startup, input, run, exit), and you should encapsulate any code not related to this in methods and classes.   As a rule of thumb, the length of your main should be minimized.  <b>This is one of the main learning goals in CS 174</b>
                        </p>

                    <h2><a name = "indentation">1. Indentation / Brackets</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        All code must follow proper indentation and bracket conventions.  This includes, but is not limited to, conditionals, loops, and methods.  Brackets should be at the end of each if statement, even if the body contains only one line.  You should get into the habit of setting up your brackets and tabbing when you first complete a method, loop, or conditional statement, but before you type anything in it.  If you go completely off the rails, Netbeans can save you if you click <code>Source->Format</code>
                    </p>

                    <div id="badcode">
                        <h3>Problematic Code</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        First of all, this code is missing brackets around the if statement.  This makes it easy to have a bug if you decide to add the line, because only the first line is considered to be in the body of the if statement.  Second of all, the tabbing is all over the place.  This makes it easy to miss a closing brace somewhere, which can be very difficult to resolve for multiply nested blocks.

                        These comments should appear above the method name in a particular format, which makes it easy to automatically generate web pages describing the code (for instance, see documentation for the <a href = "https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/javadoc/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/StdAudio.html">audio code</a> we've been using, which was generated this way).  In NetBeans, if you type out the definition of the method and then type <code>/**</code> followed by <code>ENTER</code>, it will automatically generate a correctly formatted comment, which you can fill in with details.  Below is an example (courtesy of <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/133-ann-marie-v-schilling">Professor Schilling</a>) of what it should look like:

                            Code will be graded on appropriate loop choice.  Using a while where a for loop is more appropriate will result in a deduction.  You should use a do while loop where appropriate.  Breaking out of a loop for any condition aside from the loop control will result in a deduction.

                            Since the loop below starts at 0 and stops at 9, a for loop is much more appropriate.  Furthermore, the code uses a break statement, which can be confusing.

                                            Code must be efficient as possible without sacrificing readability.  This includes, but is not limited to chaining your if statements, using the least amount of variable declarations as possible, and using the smallest data type necessary.  For instance, if the user is to answer 1,2,3,4 as a response, use an int, not a double.
