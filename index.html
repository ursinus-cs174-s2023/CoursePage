										I grew up right around the corner in the Montgomery County and attended <a href = "https://www.udsd.org/schools/udhs/">Upper Dublin High school</a> (class of 2007).  I then did my undergraduate degree in <a href = "https://ee.princeton.edu/">Electrical Engineering</a> at Princeton University and my master's and Ph.D. degrees in <a href = "https://ece.duke.edu/">Electrical And Computer Engineering</a> at Duke University (heavily studying math and CS along the way).  I finally started my dream job at Ursinus College in Fall of 2019!  You can read more about my interests on my <a href = "http://www.ctralie.com/">professional web site</a>.  Looking forward to getting to know everyone as we work through this course together!

									<h3>Course Description</h3>
									<p>
										<!--As stated in Harvey Mudd's <a href = "https://www.cs.hmc.edu/csforallbook/">CS For All Book</a> "An important principle in computer science is “if you are building lots of very similar things, try instead to build one thing that can do it all.”"!-->

										This course is the continuation of <a href = "http://www.billmongan.com/Ursinus-CS173/">CS 173</a>, and it can be seen as the second part of an introductory computer science and introductory programming sequence.  
									</p>

									<p>
										Now that students are familiar with the fundamentals of programming, such as variable types, conditional statements, loops, and methods, the class will branch out into two more sophisticated directions: <b>systems programming</b> and <b>object oriented programming</b>.  This class will prepare students for more advanced work in computer architecture and data structures, respectively.
									</p>

									<p>
										In systems programming, we look "under the hood" at how programs are really run on the computer, digging into things such as <b>memory (de)allocation</b>, or where variables actually get stored, and <b>metaprogramming</b>, or the process of automating and running code from the command line.  For this reason, our language of choice in this class will be C++, which has syntax very similar to Java, but which requires a lot more care managing memory and program compilation.  <!--Towards the end of the course, we will strip back the language slightly to a subset known as C, will begin to examine "assembly language," or the machine code that C compiles into before it's executed on your computer's processor.  Time permitting, we will examine a common vulnerability in programs known as a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow">buffer overrun attack</a>.!-->
									</p>
										
									<p>	
										In object oriented programming, on the other hand, we zoom out focus more on the <i>design</i> of programs at a high level.  The goal is to make programs that are easy to read and maintain by others.  At the core of object oriented programming are <b>classes</b>, or their instances: <b>objects</b> (hence, the name).  While we always have primitive variable types, such as <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>, and <code>char</code> at our disposal, a class can be though of as a "designer variable type."  For example, we can make a "Person" class that stores the name, age, and height of a person.  That might look something like this in C++:

										<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
											class Person {
												private:
													char* name;
													int age;
													double height;
												public:
													Person(char* name, int age, double height) {
														this->name = name;
														this->age = age;
														this->height = height;
													}
											};
											
											int main() {
												Person chris((char*)"Chris", 32, 6.08);

												// ...do more stuff, etc, etc...

												return 0;
											}
										]]></script>  

										An instance of a class is known as an <i>object</i>.  Just like <code>10</code> is an example of an <code>int</code>, <code>chris</code> is an example of a person, whose name is "Chris", whose age is 31, and whose height is 6.08 feet.  In this way, we have <i>encapsulated</i> (i.e. "placed in a capsule") what it means to be a person all in once place.  This makes it way easier to define multiple people, as we don't have to define separate variables for their name, age, and height each time.  Moreover, we can start to create <i>instance methods</i> in a class that can be used to change the state of a particular object.  For instance, a method <code>void doBirthday()</code> could increment the age of a person by 1 (e.g. <code>chris.doBirthday()</code> would change the age of the <code>chris</code> object to 33).
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Objects allow us to enforce two principles that make software much more usable and easier to maintain: <b>modularity</b> and <b>reusability</b>.  Modularity refers to the ability to encapsulate everything doing related tasks under one umbrella, while reusability refers to versatile, general purpose code that doesn't have to be completely rewritten for minor changes.  Both of these properties should be apparent from any well-executed object oriented design.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										As was emphasized in CS 173, a high level programming language like C++ gives us an intuitive, organized way to talk to computers, but computer science is automation and computing in general, not tied to a specific language.  In this course, we will be exploring C++, but the focus is on programming in general in the service of a broad, interdisciplinary array of applications.  A few examples of programs students will be working on include
										<ul>
											<li>
												Creating virtual models of 3D cities.
											</li>
											<li>
												Steganography, or the process of hiding data in one format in plain sight in another format.
											</li>
											<li>
												Creating a simulation of strategies to eradicate invasive species
											</li>
											<li>
												Implementing parts of the <a href = "https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf">"Shazam algorithm"</a> to automatically determine what song someone is listening to based on a small clip of audio.
											</li>
										</ul>

												<a name = "sensitive">*</a>: For <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Educational_Rights_and_Privacy_Act">privacy reasons</a>, anything of a personal nature, and particularly things that have to with educational records (e.g. grades), need to be kept within Ursinus sanctioned platforms like Outlook e-mail and Microsoft Teams.
											</p>
	
											<h3>Canvas</h3>
											<p>
												We will be using Canvas, but only to submit assignments and to store all of the grades.  I will also keep all of the due dates current on the calendar there, as students have appreciated this common space for all of their classes in the past.
											</p>

	
											<h3><a name = "discord">Discord</a></h3>
											<p>
												To facilitate informal, class-wide discussions about the class, as well as <a href = "#buddy">buddy group coding</a> with screen sharing, we will have a Discord channel for the class.  My goal is for this to turn into a flourishing area to work through <a href = "#confusion">confusion</a> and to share ideas as a group.  All questions are welcome!  To help break down the barrier of asking questions, we will be using the chat bot <a href = "https://nminchow.github.io/VoltaireWeb/">Voltaire</a> so students can ask questions anonymously.  This has worked very well in the past. <b>We will also keep the CS 174 Discord channel open during class for polling and for general questions for students who are shy about speaking up verbally in front of their peers.</b>
											</p>
											<p>
												In addition to the regular channel, we will be holding drop-in student office hours on Tuesdays on the Ursinus ACM Discord channel, since student office hours are joint between my classes.  You can find it under the "Chit Chat" Category, as shown below
											</p>
											<p>
												<img src = "OfficeHours.png">
											</p>
											<p>
												<b>Do not</b> send me direct messages or anything of a sensitive nature (e.g. grades) over Discord.  Instead, use <a href = "#teams">Microsoft Teams</a> or e-mail for that, since those transactions are locked down better under Ursinus control.
											</p>

											
	
	
											<h3><a name = "teams">Microsoft Teams</a></h3>
											<p>
												For one on one direct messages with me, we will be using  <a href = "https://insights.ursinus.edu/display/LEI/Microsoft+Teams">Microsoft Teams</a>, which is linked to your Office suite through Ursinus, so you are automatically enrolled.

											<h2><a name = "readings">Readings</a></h2>

Instead, I will sometimes link to online resources on the <a href = "#schedule">schedule</a>, or I will have you read something or watch a video and complete exercises <a href = "#preclass">before class</a> for initial exposure to some topics.  I will also write and share notes on the schedule to summarize things that we did in class, as needed.

											<h3><a name = "programming">Programming Assignments</a></h3>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                                The bulk of the grade in the course will be earned by completing 5 medium scale programming assignments and one large scale one (the "Shazam algorithm" at the end).  Be sure to start them early, since debug time can often be unpredictable!  Refer to the <a href = "#collaboration">collaboration and sharing rules</a> for these assignments.
											</p>

											<h3><a name = "labs">Labs</a></h3>
											<p>
												As in CS 173, we will have a number of labs throughout the course.  Generally, our 30 minute Wednesday blocks will be devoted to these, and final submissions will be due the following Monday.  Collaboration is more open here, and I will generally provide more starter code relative to the programming assignments, since the idea is for students to get some initial exposure and to practice ideas before moving onto more complicated things.
											</p>

											<h3><a name = "debugging">Debugging Principles</a></h3>
											<p>
												If you're taking this course, then you've certainly had experience with <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging">debugging</a>, but it is a skill you will still need to work on, so you should expect to hit some roadblocks.  In fact, it is time consuming and difficult even for very experienced programmers.  So do not be hard on yourself if your programs don't work the first time around (they rarely do, even if you've been programming for decades!).
											</p>

											<p>
												I have had nearly 20 years of programming experience at this point, and I have learned the hard way what works and what doesn't.  Here are my main debugging principles in a nutshell
											</p>
											<ol>
												<li>
													<a name = "adequatetime"></a>Leave yourself <b>adequate time</b> to work on the assignments, because the amount of time it takes to resolve issues can be unpredictable.
												</li>
												<li>
													<a name = "smallbits"></a>Write <b>small bits of code and test them right away.</b>  Don't write a wall of code and test it, only to find out that something doesn't work.  By contrast, if you write bits at a time, you will know right away what code you wrote caused things to be wrong.
												</li>
												<li>
													<a name = "scientificmethod"></a>Apply the <b>scientific method</b>: have in mind hypothesis for what might be wrong, design a quick experiment to test your hypothesis, draw conclusions, and repeat.
												</li>
												<li>
													<a name = "failquickly"></a><b>Fail quickly</b>.  If you're working on a larger scale program that processes a lot of data, do not wait for several minutes for data to load every time you make a small change.  Instead, come up with the minimum, simplest experiment you possibly can which will tell you whether your code is correct or not.
												</li>
												<li>
													<a name = "testcode"></a>Don't forget that you can <b>write code to help you automate debugging</b>.  Otherwise, it's sometimes tedious to repeat the same steps over and over again as you're changing things.
												</li>
												<li>
													<a name = "walkaway"></a><b>Know when to walk away.</b>  We often get stuck in loops wanting to resolve things, but then our logical thinking goes out the window and we start randomly trying different things.  Even if you're up against the clock, it is often good to take a little break and come back again a little bit later.
												</li>
											</ol>
	
											
											
	

											<h3><a name = "preclass">Class Engagement / Pre-Class Work</a></h3>
                                            
                                            <p>
												It's easier to learn difficult subjects like object oriented and systems programming by going through a number of examples on each topic beyond the examples in the large assignments.  Because of this, we will often do small programming exercises and experiments in class related to a topic that we're learning.  At times, I may ask you to read over a description of an exercise or to read some notes about a new topic before class so we can go more deeply into the examples.  I may also ask you to hand in something small related to the class exercises to make sure you were putting effort in during class.  This will all make up a small part of your <a href = "#grading">grade</a> in the class.

											<h3><a name = "deadlines">Deadlines</a></h3>

											<p>
											The purpose of deadlines is to keep students on track as they work through the course to avoid a snowball effect, and <b>deadlines will be strictly enforced for this reason</b>.  This is a <b>department wide departure from the unfettered flexibility we gave during the earlier stages of the pandemic</b>.  That said, if students have accommodations or if other life events come up, they should <a href = "#logistics">communicate with me</a> <b>at least 3 days in advance of any deadline</b> to request an extension.  In the absence of said communications, all assignments are due at 11:59PM EST on the date(s) stated on the <a href = "#schedule">schedule</a>.  Students can turn in those assignments past the deadlines, and the scores will be adjusted as follows:
											</p>

											<ul>
											<li>-5% for work submitted between 1 minute - 6 hours late</li>
											<li>-10% for work submitted up to 12 hours late</li>
											<li>-15% for work submitted up to 24 hours late</li>
											<li>-25% for work submitted up to 48 hours late</li>
											<li>-40% for work submitted up to 96 hours late</li>
											<li>-50% for work submitted more than 96 hours late</li>

											<h2><a name = "environment">Classroom Environment</a></h2>

											<h3><a name = "inclusive">Inclusive Environment</a></h3>

											<p>
												Computer science is a field that has <a href = "https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16153740/tech-diversity-problem-science-history-explainer-inequality">historically been and continues to be</a> steeped in inequalities.  We will do our best to put the topics we're working on into the appropriate historical context, and to address broader societal issues that are related to the code that we write.  We will strive to do better in our course, with an honest look at where we have been in the field.  To that end, my goal is to foster a environment in which students across all axes of diversity feel welcome and valued, both by me and by their peers.  Axes of diversity include, but are not limited to, age, background, beliefs, race, ethnicity, gender/gender identity/gender expression (feel free to tell me in person or over e-mail which pronouns I should use), national origin, religious affiliation, and sexual orientation.  Discrimination of any form will not be tolerated.
											</p>

											<p>
												<a name = "confusion">.</a>Furthermore, I want all students to feel comfortable expressing their opinions or confusion at any point in the course, as long as they do so respectfully.  As I will stress over and over, being confused is an important part of the process of learning computer science.  Learning computer science and struggling to grow is <a href = "https://i0.wp.com/katielmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1_9HzbByi2Uzit8474Rp4ZPg-1.jpg?w=550&ssl=1">not always comfortable</a>, but I want it to feel safe.  In other words, I will regularly keep you at the boundary of your comfort zone with challenging, real-world assignments, but I want you to feel comfortable with me and your peers and respected as a learner during the process<a name = "communication">.</a>
											</p>

											<p>
												Finally, I am aware that, particularly during the pandemic, there are a variety of factors that may make it difficult to perform at your best level in class.  At Ursinus, we are fortunate to have quite a mix of students from different backgrounds, many of whom need to work part time, and an increasing number of whom are commuters and have family obligations.  If you find yourself having difficulty performing at the level that you want because of any of these issues, communicate with me, and we can come up with a solution together (I will gently reach out if I notice any slips even if you don't communicate).  This is a foundational course for the CS major, and I want to work to keep your excitement alive, regardless of your personal circumstances.  <u><b>You belong in CS!</b></u>
											</p>


											<HR>
											<h2><a name = "participation">Participation</a></h2>


											
											<h3>Classroom Attendance And Etiquette</h3>

											<p>
												Students are expected to attend class in person.  We're shooting for <b>engagement</b> over mere attendance; students are expected to be active in class exercises and to be fully invested in the class (i.e. no internet browsing).  Students who are unable to attend class for significant reasons (whether isolation or quarantine for students who have received a positive test, those experiencing Covid-related symptoms while awaiting test results, or other issues that make it difficult to attend class) should work pro-actively to make up any <a href = "#preclass">class exercises</a> that they missed.  To help with this, I will do my best to put up Youtube videos from myself and other instructors, as well as class notes, on topics that we cover.
											</p>

											<p>
												Finally, students are expected to follow any college policy requiring mask wearing on campus, in addition to following any guidance faculty provide for their individual classes. Masks should be available in every academic building, if needed.
											</p>



											<h3>Maximizing Your Communal Experience</h3>
											<p>
												Here are ways students can maximize their experience as a class community, and which <b>could lead to extra credit in certain situations</b>.
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Helping to teach a student a topic during office hours.</li>
												<li>Certain calls for participation in class</li>
												<li>Particularly helpful or insightful messages on Discord</li>
												<li>Finding mistakes in the book or on the assigned homework </li>
											</ul>

											<h3>Discord Communication Policy</h3>
											Since this is a class-wide communication, the following rules apply to online communication
											<ul>
												<li>
													Students are expected to be respectful and mindful of the <a href = "#environment">classroom environment and inclusivity standards</a>.  They are equally applicable to a virtual environment as they are in class.</li>

												<li>
													Students <b>are not</b> permitted to publicly share direct answers or questions which might completely give away answers to any homework problems.  When in doubt, send me a direct message on Microsoft Teams.
												</li>

												<li>
													I will attempt to answer questions real time during student office hours.  Otherwise, I will make every attempt to respond within 24 hours on weekdays.  <i>I cannot be expected to respond at all on Saturdays or Sundays or outside of 10AM-8PM on weekdays</i>, so plan accordingly.  (Of course, students can and should still respond to each other outside of these intervals, when appropriate).
                                                </li>
											</ul>

											<h2><a name = "collaboration">Collaboration Policy</a></h2>

											<h3>Overall Philosophy</h3>
											<p>
											    The collaboration policy for this class walks the line between encouraging openness and collaboration during a challenging learning process, while also making sure that each students is progressing technically at an individual level without relying on 100% on other classmates.  Communication between students is allowed (and encouraged!) on most assignments, but it is expected that every student's code or writeups will be completely distinct.  Do not copy code off of the Internet.  Do cite any sources in addition to materials linked from the course website that you used to help in crafting your code and completing the assignment.
                                            </p>
											
											<h3><a name = "buddy">Assignment Buddies</a></h3>
                                            <p>
                                                To encourage collaboration, students will be allowed (not required) to choose one or more "<b>buddies</b>" to work "near" during assignments and labs.  Students are still expected to submit their own solutions, but they are allowed to provide substantial help to each other, and even to look at each others' code during the process.  Students should indicate their buddies in the README upon assignment submission.  Let me know if you would like a buddy but are having trouble finding one.
											</p>

											<p>
												For the labs, collaboration rules are slightly more permissive beyond buddies.  See the collaboration grid below.
											</p>
											
											<h3>Individual Assignments</h3>
											<p>
												There will be a few assignments that students are expected to complete on their own with no communication with anyone but me.  They will be limited in number, but this will be just to make sure every individual students is progressing technically.  You can think of them like an open-ended, open-book take-home quiz where you can ask me questions.
											</p>

											<h3>Collaboration Scenarios Table</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                Below is a table spelling out in more detail when and how you are allowed to share code with people (table style cribbed from <a href = "https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring19/cos126/syllabus.html">Princeton CS 126</a>).  </p>

                                                If the collaboration policy has been violated in any way, regardless of intent, then it may be an academic dishonesty case, and it will be referred to <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/184-">the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs</a>.  I am required to make this report in every occurrence, so it is best to speak with me first if there are any questions about the policy or expectations. You should feel free to have these conversations with me anytime prior to making your submission without fear of penalty. 
											</p>
											
											<p>
												On a more personal note, though a willful violation of academic honesty may seem merely transactional to a student, faculty take violations very personally, as they are disrespectful to the time and effort we put into our courses.  I would also like to emphasize that <b>your reputation is much more important than your grades</b>.  The recommendations we as faculty write go a long way, and we are much happier to write positive recommendations for students with lower grades who show grit and growth than we are to write recommendations for students with higher grades who have cheated.
											</p>

										<HR>
											<h2><a name = "other">Other Resources / Policies</a></h2>

											<h3><a name = "accommodations">Accommodations</a></h3>

											<p>
												In addition to our general awareness diversity, Ursinus College is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities.  Students with a disability should contact the Directory of Disability Services ASAP.  Dolly Singley is located in the Center for Academic Support in the lower level of Myrin Library.  Visit <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/institute-for-student-success/students-with-disabilities/current-students-/">this link</a> for more information on the process.  I will do my best to accommodate your requests, and they will be kept completely confidential.
											</p>

											<h3><a name = "tutoring">One on One Tutoring</a></h3>
											<p>
												One on one tutoring for up to two hours per week is available through the institute for student success.  Please <a href = "https://bit.ly/UC_ISS_WCOnline">click here</a> to fill out a Qualtrics survey if you'd like to take advantage of this.
											</p>

											<h3>Let's Talk</h3>
											<p>
												Mental health care is increasingly recognized as a crucial service for the undergraduate population.  Please visit <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/wellness-center/">this link</a> for more information about complementary counseling services provided by the college.  The Wellness Center has a virtual drop-in crisis hour at 2-3 pm each weekday, which is available for students in crisis who need to be seen immediately by a clinician.  If you are still hesitant to go, take me (Professor Tralie) as an example of someone who has benefited greatly from talk therapy in the past.  I am happy to discuss this in office hours in more detail.
											</p>

											<p>
												Beyond that, please have a look at <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eFxdMcPxRnCqnH6iLDIo4S2zLqSX9ltapLJJlz5uWKM/edit">this document</a> for a variety of resources related to mental health at Ursinus.
											</p>
											<p>
												Finally, be aware that there are resources outside of mental health care proper to address some core sources of mental stress and strain, such as time management and writing at the <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/institute-for-student-success/">Institute for Student Success</a> and the <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/center-for-writing-and-speaking/">Center for Writing And Speaking</a>.
											</p>

											<h3>Title IX</h3>
											<p>
												Title IX is a federal law, under which it is prohibited to discriminate on the basis of gender. The <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/title-ix/">Title IX Coordinator</a> is available to receive inquiries and to investigate allegations in this regard. 
											</p>

											<h3>Inclement Weather Policy</h3>
											<p>
												In the event that the College closes due to inclement weather or other circumstances, our in-person class sessions, drop-in office hours, or other meetings will not be held. I will contact you regarding our plan with regard to rescheduling the class or the material, any assignments that are outstanding, and how we can move forward with the material (for example, any readings or remote discussions that we can apply). If necessary, I may schedule online virtual sessions in lieu of class sessions, and will contact you with information about how to participate in those. I will communicate this plan to the department so that it can be posted on my office door if it is feasible to do so. This policy and procedure will also apply in the event that the College remains open but travel conditions are hazardous or not otherwise conducive to holding class as normal. Should another exigent circumstance arise (for example, illness), I will follow this policy and procedure as well.
