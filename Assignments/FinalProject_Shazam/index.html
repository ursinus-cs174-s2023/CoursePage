                                        <h2><a name = "overview">Overview / Logistics</a></h2>
										<p>
                                            We have now reached the climax of the course!  This assignment is a direct followup to the <a href = "../HW5_BasketballHashing/">last assignment on basketball hashing</a>.  Now that we have a hash table implementation, we're going to use it for an even more exciting task of quickly identifying a song from a short (and possibly degraded) audio clip of that song.  We will be implementing the so-called "<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shazam_(application)">Shazam</a> algorithm," which you can read more about in <a href = "Wang03-shazam.pdf">this paper</a>, and which I have broken down with audio examples at <a href = "background.html">this link</a>.  In a nutshell, we will be building something called an <b>audio fingerprint</b>, which can be used to identify songs from short clips of audio.
                                        </p>

										<h3><a name = "design">The Design Is Yours!</a></h3>
										<p>
											I am giving you the freedom to design the code any way you want in this assignment, so you should take some time to plan out what you're going to do before you start coding.  Think about what classes you're going to write, what entry point programs with mains you'll write to run your code, and how everything will fit together.  Your code should be <b>modular</b>, <b>reusable</b>, and <b>well encapsulated</b>.

										<h2><a name = "code"><a name = "startercode">Starter Code / Utilities</a></a></h2>
											<p>
												You can obtain the code for this assignment with 
											</p>

											<p>
												<code>
													git clone --recursive https://github.com/ursinus-cs174-s2022/FinalProject_Shazam.git
												</code>
											</p>

											<p>
												You'll have to design all of the code to do the Shazam algorithm yourself, but I've started you off with utilities for loading audio and computing and plotting <a href = "background.html#spectrograms">audio spectrograms</a>.  To see how these all work together, have a look at the code in <a href = "https://github.com/ursinus-cs174-s2022/FinalProject_Shazam/blob/main/plotSpectrogram.cpp">plotSpectrogram.cpp</a>
											</p>

											<h3><a name = "spectrograms">Audio spectrograms</a></h3>

											<p>
												As an example of an audio spectrogram, let's say we wanted to do an STFT on the example query "despacitoClean.wav" provided with this code, using a window length of 1024, a hop length of 512, and a cutoff of 128 frequency bins. Then we'd run this:
											</p>

											<p>
												Code has been provided with your assignment to generate spectrograms from audio clips.  For example, if we run the following code
												
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp">./plotSpectrogram --audiopath ExampleQueries/despacitoLaptop.wav --impath spectrogramLaptop.png --win 1024 --hop 512 --maxBin 128</script>
											</p>

											<p>
												It will yield this image
											</p>

											<p>
												<img src = "spectrogram.png" width="80%">
											</p>

											<p>
												Have a look at <code><a href = "FinalProject_Shazam/plotSpectrogram.cpp">plotSpectrogram.cpp</a></code> for an example of how to load in audio and construct a spectrogram with the provided code.
											</p>

											<h3>
												<a name = "debugplot">Debugging by Plotting</a>
											</h3>
											<p>
												I am a big proponent of debugging with visual output.  <a href = "../../index.html#smallbits">As you're going along</a> and computing <a href = "background.html#anchors">anchors</a> and <a href = "background.html#fingerprints">fingerprints</a>, I would highly recommend plotting them on examples to make sure your code is working properly.  You can use the <code>SimpleCanvas</code> library that we've been using with all of the other assignments/labs involving images.  Documentation for SimpleCanvas can be found at <a href = "https://ursinus-cs174-s2022.github.io/simplecanvas/docs/html/classSimpleCanvas.html">this link</a>.  <b>Just note that the spectrograms are actually plotted upside down!</b>  So you may have to flip your anchors/fingerprints.
											</p>

											<p>
												As a snippet to get you started, here's some code that computes a spectrogram on a 1D array <code>samples</code> with <b>N</b> audio samples
											</p>

											<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp">
												// Create spectrogram
												int win = 1024;
												int hop = 512;
												int maxBin = 128; // Height of the spectrogram S (number of rows)
												DSP dsp(win);
												int NWin; // Width of the spectrogram S (number of cols)
												double** S = dsp.spectrogram(samples, N, win, hop, true, &NWin);
												// Plot the spectrogram S and save to an image
												SimpleCanvas canvas = plotSpectrogram(S, maxBin, NWin, 1, 1);
												canvas.write("spectrogram.png");
											</script>

											<h3><a name = "precomputed">Precomputed Fingerprints</a></h3>
											<p>
												The starter code comes with fingerprints from 8 full length songs using the following parameters for the spectrogram
												<ul>
													<li><code>win = 1024</code></li>
													<li><code>hop = 512</code></li>
													<li><code>maxBin = 128</code></li>
												</ul>
											</p>

											<p>
												and the following parameters for the anchors
												<ul>
													<li><code>freqWin = 8</code></li>
													<li><code>int timeWin = 6</code></li>
												</ul>
											</p>

											<p>
												and the following parameters for the fingerprints
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													<code>dCenter = 86</code>
												</li>
												<Li>
													<code>width = 50</code>
												</Li>
												<li>
													<code>height = 21</code>
												</li>
											</ul>


											<p>
												<b>To make sure your queries are compatible with these examples, you should use the same parameters for the spectrograms when computing new fingerprints.</b>
											</p>

											<p>
												The 8 precomputed songs can be found in the folder <code><a href = "https://github.com/ursinus-cs174-s2022/FinalProject_Shazam/tree/main/Database">Database</a></code>.  They are stored in plain text files with the following conventions:
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>The first line is the name of the artist</li>
												<li>The second line is the name of the song</li>
												<li>Every subsequent line contains a fingerprint formatted into a <a href = "background.html#hashcode">hash code</a>, followed by the window index at which that fingerprint occurs in the song</li>
											</ul>

											<p>
												For example, the first 10 lines of <code>0.txt</code> look like:
											</p>

											<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp">
												Kanye West
												Touch the Sky
												2884098 102
												3539458 102
												4129282 102
												7143938 102
												5113858 102
												6359298 102
												8587778 102
												7212034 102
												...
											</script>

											<b>NOTE:</b>
											<p>
												The time index of the queries is taken to be the <b>left anchor</b> of the fingerprint to be consistent with the database I have setup.
											</p>


											<h4>Stress Testing</h4>
											<p>
												You should start by making sure you can correctly identify the given 10 second clips in <a href = "https://github.com/ursinus-cs174-s2022/FinalProject_Shazam/tree/main/ExampleQueries">example queries</a> among the 8 examples in this database.  Once you're confident your code is working well, you can make the problem harder and see if you can identify those same clips among a database of 275 songs, which can be downloaded at <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rjcIW81FpMMnik0P4o8W6HWZqL420ShB/view?usp=sharing">this link</a>.
											</p>

											<h3><a name = "hash">Hash Maps</a></h3>
											<p>
												Code has not been provided for this, but when you're ready to look up queries in the database, you should splice in your hash map code from <a href = "../HW5_BasketballHashing/">homework 5</a> to help you look up fingerprints quickly.
											</p>


											

										<HR>
										<h2><a name = "programming">Programming Tasks</a></h2>

										<h3><a name = "main">Main Program Specification</a></h3>
										<p>
											Your code should culminate in a program called <code>query</code>, which takes two command line arguments:
											<ol>
												<li>A path to a query audio file to be identified</li>
												<li>A path to a folder containing a <a href = "#precomputed">database of precomputed fingerprints</a></li>
											</ol>
											Your program should then load in the query audio and fingerprints in the database, and it should output the artist name and song name of the song in the database that is the best match to the query file.  
										</p>

										<p>
											As an example, if you typed in 
										</p>

										<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp">
											./query ExampleQueries/despacitoNoise.wav Database
										</script>

										<p>
											Your program should output <code>Luis Fonsi ft Daddy Yankee - Despacito</code>
										</p>

										<h3><a name = "efficiency">Efficiency</a></h3>
										<p>
											Your program should be very fast on the database of just 8 songs!  Even on the database of 275 songs, my code only takes about 10 seconds to load the entire database, and the query is nearly instantaneous.  The key to making this work efficiently is to use a hash table.  You can use as many buckets as there are unique <a href = "background#hashing">hash codes</a>, which is roughly 17 million.
										</p>

										<h3><a name = "debugging">Debugging Tools</a></h3>
										<p>
											Of course, you'll probably want to write several other programs to help you test as you go along.  Below are a few suggestions:
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												A program that computes and plots the <a href = "background.html#anchors">constellation</a> for a particular audio clip (note that plotting is upside down)</li>
											</li>
											<li>
												A program that computes and plots the <a href = "background.html#fingerprints">fingerprints</a> for a particular audio clip</li>
											</li>
											<li>
												A program that parses one of the database example text files and loads its fingerprints into a hash map
											</li>
											<li>
												A program that prints out information about <a href = "background.html#queries">histograms that you make</a> of the difference between a fingerprint's window index in the database and the fingerprint's window index in the audio.
											</li>
											<li>
												...other things to help you debug?!
											</li>
										</ul>


										<h3><a name = "further">Going Further!</a></h3>
										<p>
											At this point, you have a fully functional basic implementation of audio fingerprinting for content-based music retrieval.  This is not required, but you should try it on your own music!  See if you can add a song to the database and query it with a clip.  Note that the parameters are setup so that the database is expecting single channel audio sampled at 22050hz in the .wav file format.  You can use <a href = "https://www.audacityteam.org/download/">Audacity</a> to do the conversion.  Questions to ask yourself as you go include:
											<ul>
												<li>
													How much audio does it seem like you need to do a robust identification?
												</li>
												<li>
													How noisy or distorted does can the audio be before the identification fails?
												</li>
												<li>
													Does this work on different versions of the song (e.g. cover songs)?  Why do you think that might be?
												</li>
											</ul>
										</p>

										<p>
											Beyond that, you can also write code to create clips to fool the Shazam algorithm, like I did in <a href = "http://www.beepytunes.com/">http://www.beepytunes.com/</a>.  This is as simple as creating a tune that has short time cosines at every anchor location in the constellation.
