                                            The purpose of this <a href = "../../index.html#collaboration">individual assignment</a> is to enable you to brush up on your knowledge of methods and how they fit together, and to practice them in a new language: C++.  It is also an opportunity to practice reading documentation for existing methods to learn how to use them, which is something you will often do in practice, since we rarely re-invent the wheel and often use code that other people write (often called a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)">library</a>).  
										</p>

										<p>
											This assignment will also get you to practice the <b>edit -> compile -> run -> edit</b> loop, since you will have to tweak your shapes many times to get a good result.
										</p>
										
										<p>
											The specific task in this assignment is to write code to generate 3D worlds.  It's much easier if you write methods whose sole job is to draw a particular city object, like a fire hydrant or stop light. Then, you can replicate these objects many times by calling the methods over and over again to create complicated parts of the your world (like city blocks).  Putting complicated things completely in one chunk of code to be reused many times with minor variations is an example of <b>encapsulation</b>, which is a major theme of this class.
										</p>

                                        <p>
                                            You can download the code for this assignment by using git in the terminal

									<h2><a name = "coordinates">Background: 3D Coordinate Systems</a></h2>
									
									<p>
										A point in 3D space is represented with 3 coordinates: one in the x-axis, one in the y-axis, and one in the z-axis.  There are a few different ways to define such a coordinate system, but we will stick to the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL">OpenGL</a> convention in this class.  Below is a sketch of the positive coordinate axes for x, y, and z.  A point (a, b, c) can be obtained by creating a rectangular prism with side length a along the x-axis, b along the y-axis, and c along the z-axis.  The point then resides on the vertex of the cube furthest from the origin where the three axes meet (the red point).
									</p>


									<img src = "Coords3D.svg">

									<h2><a name = "colors">Background: RGB Colors</a></h2>

									<p>
										In addition to perceiving space in 3 dimensions, humans interestingly also perceive color in 3 dimensions.  One basis for color representation is the "RGB" or "Red, Green, Blue" axes.  Each axis is represented with 8 bits, so possible values are from 0 (no color) to 255 (full saturation of that color).  For instance, <font color = "red">rgb(255, 0, 0)</font> is red, and <font color="blue">rgb(0, 0, 255)</font> is blue.
									</p>


									<p>
										The widget below allows you to play around with colors, which you may want to do for the <a href = "#artcontest">art contest</a>.

									<h3><a href = "ggslac/viewers/SceneViewer.html">Click here</a> to launch the scene viewer in your browser</h3>

									<p>
										In this assignment, you will be creating 3D worlds, also known as "scenes," that can be loaded into an engine I made for my <a href = "https://ursinus-cs476-f2020.github.io/CoursePage/">computer graphics class</a> known as <a href = "https://github.com/ctralie/ggslac">ggslac</a>.  As in the <a href = "../../Labs/Lab1_Holidays/">HTML holidays</a> lab, your C++ program will write code that this engine can interpret (though it is <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> code instead of HTML).  You don't have to worry writing code strings yourself this time, though.  Instead, I have provided a series of high level functions that you can use to draw shapes, and which will automatically convert to code on the backend that you can open in <a href = "ggslac/viewers/SceneViewer.html">the engine</a>, as shown below.
									</p>

									<img src = "OpenScene.gif">

									<p>
										The full documentation for drawing shapes can be found <a href = "docs/classScene3D.html">at this link</a>. Below are a few examples with links to the respective documentation.  There are two versions of most methods: one for drawing an "axis-aligned" shape, and one for drawing a rotated version.  You'll mostly be using the axis-aligned versions in the tasks.
									</p>
									<!--For the regular assignment, you won't have to worry about using any of the rotated versions of shapes, but you may want to play around with them and use them for the <a href = "#artcontest">art contest</a>-->

									<h2><a name = "programming">Programming Tasks</a></h2>

									<p>
										You will start by making a series of methods that draw specific city objects.  Since you'll want to draw many copies of these in different places, <b>you must specify parameters to move the shapes around</b>.  For example, if I have a box that's normally centered at (1, 2, 5), I should be able to specify a difference of <code>cx</code> and <code>cz</code> to shift it in the X and Z directions, so that the new box would be centered at (1+cx, 2, 5+cz)  <i>You don't have to get the exact shapes that are shown in the pictures</i>, but you should get reasonably close.  I'll start by giving you a simple example below that draws a street sign.
									</p>

									<h3><a name = "sign">Example: Sign</a></h3>
									<p>
										We can draw a simple sign with a thin cylinder for its poll and a thin box for the sign itself.  Below is an example of how one might accomplish this with a method
									</p>

									<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
										/**
										* Draw a simple sign that consists of a 2 meter tall cylinder for the
										* poll and a 0.5x0.5x0.02 meter box for the sign itself
										* 
										* @param scene The scene to which to add the sign (passed by reference)
										* @param cx Center of the sign in x
										* @param cz Center of the sign in z
										* @param isEastWest If true, the sign is oriented from east to west.  Otherwise,
										*                   the sign is oriented from north to south
										* @param r Red component of the sign
										* @param g Green component of the sign
										* @param b Blue component of the sign
										*/
										void drawSign(Scene3D& scene, double cx, double cz, 
																	bool isEastWest, double r, double g, double b) {
											// Draw the main pole
											scene.addCylinder(cx, 1, cz, 0.05, 2, 127, 127, 127); 
											if (isEastWest) {
												// Draw a 0.5 x 0.5 box in the X/Y plane, with a thin dimension in Z
												scene.addBox(cx, 2, cz, 0.5, 0.5, 0.1, r, g, b);
											}
											else {
												// Draw a 0.5 x 0.5 box in the Y/Z plane, with a thin dimension in X
												scene.addBox(cx, 2, cz, 0.1, 0.5, 0.5, r, g, b);
											}
										}    
									   ]]></script>

									<p>
										Here's an example code snippet that calls this method to create two signs.  For kicks, I also threw in Homer Simpson
									</p>

									<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
										// Draw a red sign 5 units in front in z and two units to 
										// the left in x that's oriented from east to west
										drawSign(scene, -2, -5, true, 255, 0, 0); // Red (255, 0, 0)
										// Draw a green sign 10 units in front of z that's 
										// oriented from north to south
										drawSign(scene, 0, -10, false, 0, 255, 0); // Green (0, 255, 0)
										// Draw a yellow Homer Simpson
										scene.addSpecialMesh("homer", 0, 1, -7, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 255, 255, 0); 
									]]></script>

									<img src = "Signs.png">
									<p>
										<b>NOTE:</b> The syntax <code>void drawSign(Scene3D& scene ...)</code> may seem a bit strange at this point in the course.  We will talk about this more later, but <code>scene</code> is an object of type <code>Scene3D</code>, and the <code>Scene3D&</code> prefix is indicating that we want to pass <code>scene</code> <b>by reference</b>.  This means that we're not creating a copy of the scene when we call the method, but we're actually referring to the same scene across methods.  Then, we can call a method within the object with <code>scene.method()</code>.  Don't worry if this doesn't totally make sense yet...just follow <code>drawSign</code> as an example when you're doing other methods, and you'll be fine.

									<p></p>
									

									<h3><a name = "makefile">Setup / Makefile (3 Points)</a></h3>
									<p>
										First, to get started, you should setup a file called <code>myscene.cpp</code> that you will compile to generate your scene.  <b>You should keep the main file very small, as per the <a href = "../../style.html#smallmain">style guide</a></b>.  As an example, you can refer to the file <code><a href = "HW1_VirtualCities/simplescene.cpp">simplescene.cpp</a></code>, which sets up the small example scene above with two signs and Homer Simpson.  Finally, to make your job quicker as you go along, you should add an appropriate entry to your makefile.
									</p>

									<h3><a name = "tree">Tree (5 Points)</a></h3>
									<p>
										Create a method that draws a simple "lollipop" tree, which consists of a brown (<font color="brown">rgb 102, 51, 0</font>) trunk of a specified height, and a green (<font color = "green">rgb 0, 255, 0</font>) ellipsoid for the "leaves."  The height should be a parameter to the method so you can draw trees of varying heights.
									</p>

									<p>
										Below is an example of an 8 meter tall tree next to a 6 meter tall tree (so calling the method twice).
									</p>

									<img src = "Tree.png">

									<h3><a name = "firehydrant">Fire hydrant (5 Points)</a></h3>

									<p>
										Create a method that draws a red <font color = "red">(rgb 255, 0, 0)</font> fire hydrant that is roughly 1 meter tall.  The fire hydrant should consist of a small cylinder at its base with a larger, thinner cylinder on top.  It should also consist of a sphere on the top of the taller cylinder, and two boxes coming out right below the sphere.
									</p>
									<img src = "FireHydrant.png">


									<h3><a name = "stoplight">Stop light (5 Points)</a></h3>

									<p>
										Create a method that draws a stop light.  The main pole on the left should be 8 meters tall, and the horizontal pole at the top should be 8 meters wide.  Attach a box to the horizontal poll that will hold the lights.  The top light should be a red (<font color = "red">rgb 255, 0, 0</font>) sphere, the middle light should be a yellow (<font color = "#cccccc00">rgb 255, 255, 0</font>) sphere, and the bottom one should be a green (<font color = "green">rgb 0, 255, 0</font>) sphere.
									</p>
									<p>
										Below is an example stoplight with a fire hydrant next to it for scale.
									</p>

									<img src = "StopLight.png">

									<h3><a name = "sedan">Sedan (5 Points)</a></h3>

									<p>
										Create a method that draws a (very boxy) car, either facing east/west or north/south, with a particular color.  It should have one box of that color that is 4.5 meters long, 1.7 meters wide, and 0.7 meters tall.  On top of that, it should have a slightly offset box that is 3.5 meters long, 1.4 meters wide, and 0.8 meters tall.  On the bottom box, there should be two grey cylinders of radius 0.5 and height 2 to represent the wheels.  For the east/west car, you will have to rotate the cylinder around the x-axis by 90 degrees, and for the north/south car, you will have to rotate the cylinder around both the x-axis and the y-axis by 90 degrees.
									</p>

									<p>
										Below is an example of a red east/west car and a yellow north/south car, with a fire hydrant and stop light for scale (that red car should probably get out of the way...)

										Create a method that creates a city block by calling the other methods.  It should have the following:
										<ul>
											<li>At least two cars</li>
											<li>At least two trees of different heights</li>
											<li>At least one fire hydrant, stop light, and sign</li>
											<li>At least one building (which can simply be a large box)</li>
										</ul>
										Here's an example
									</p>
									<img src = "CityBlock.png">
									<p>
										Finally, setup the method so that it takes an offset, and use it to draw at least two copies of this city block to create an entire city.
									</p>
									<img src = "CityBlockRepeated.png">

									<h3><a name = "style">Style (3 Points)</a></h3>

									<p>
										You will be graded on adherence to the <a href = "../../style.html">style guide</a>.  Pay particular attention to your <a href = "../../style.html#documentationmethods">method documentation</a>.
									</p>

									<h3><a name = "artcontest">Art Contest (3 Points)</a></h3>
									<p>
										Create a c++ file <code>artcontest.cpp</code> and a corresponding makefile entry to create an executable called <code>artcontest</code>, which outputs a file <code>artcontest.json</code> with any virtual world you want.  Unleash your creativity!  Your scene does not have to be a city.  Indicate in your submission a title for your scene and what name or pseudonym you would like to use for the contest.  <i>The winner will receive 5 points of extra credit.</i>
									</p>

									<p>
										In addition to the scene, you may also want to submit a movie of it.  The GIF below shows how to select two different cameras and automatically fly between them
									</p>

									<img src = "SelectingCameras.gif">

									<p>
										The result is as follows
