									<h2><a name = "vscode">Visual Studio Code</a></h2>
									<p>
										The recommended code editor for this class is <b>Microsoft Visual Studio Code</b> (VSCode).  It has nice plugins for syntax highlighting, code completion, and built in documentation for C, C++, and x64 assembly.  Visit <a href = "https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">this link</a> to download VSCode for your appropriate operating system.  Most Windows and Linux users will want the <b>64-bit</b> download.  Please post on Discord if you are having any issues installing VSCode.
									</p>

									<p>
										You may use another IDE if you would like, such as <a href = "https://atom.io/">Atom</a> or even <a href = "https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a>, but I will be assuming you're using VSCode in this class.
									</p>

									<h3><a name = "vsplugins">Recommended Plugins</a></h3>
									<p>
										You can search for plugins/extensions for VSCode by clicking on the following icon on the left of the VSCode Screen:
									</p>
									<img src = "pluginsIcon.png">
									<p>
										Below is a list of recommended plugins for this class that you should install
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>ms-vscode.cpptools</li>
										<li>ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack</li>
										<li>ms-vscode.cpptools-themes</li>
										<li>twxs.cmake</li>
										<li>streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker</li>
										<li>ehlkr.x86-64-assembly-pro</li>
									</ul>


									<h3><a name = "vscodefeatures">Quick Features Overview</a></h3>

									<p>
										Below are a few features I want to highlight that will come in handy as your working.
									</p>

									<h4>Unused variable highlighting</h4>
									<p>
										If you don't use a variable, it will show up in darker text.  This is very useful when debugging.  It means that either you didn't actually need the variable, you forgot to use it (hence you didn't complete your code), or you spelled it wrong somewhere.  This saved many a student last year! (NOTE: The examples below are in Javascript, but the same applies to C/C++/assembly)
									</p>

									<img src = "HighlightingUnused.gif" width=800>

									<h4>Replace within Selection</h4>
									<p>
										If you want to change the name of a variable in one section of your code, you can do a <code>CTRL+F</code>, which will bring up the find/replace menu, then follow these steps:
									</p>

										<h2><a name = "windows">Windows Software Environment Instructions</a></h2>

										<p>
											Below are instructions to setup a linux-like development environment on Windows
										</p>

										<h3><a name = "wslinstall"></a>Step 1: Install The <a href = "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a></h3>

										<ol>
											<li>
												<p>
												Open PowerShell as Administrator (Start menu > PowerShell > right-click > Run as Administrator)
												</p>
												
												<img src = "powershell.png">
												
												<p>
													and enter this command:
												</p>
												<p>

													<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
														dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart]]></script>  
												</p>
												<p>
													Then press <code>ENTER</code>
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												Once the above has finished, restart your machine
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													Open the Microsoft Store and select Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
												</p>
												<img src = "MicrosoftStore.png">
												<p>
													then select <code>Get</code>
												</p>
												<img src = "MicrosoftStoreGet.png">
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													Wait for the installation to complete...
												</p>
												<img src = "WSLWait.png">
											</li>
										</ol>
										
										<h3><a name = "windowsdev">Step 2: Configure Your Development Environment</a></h3>
										<p>
											Now that the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) has finished installing, we'll test it out and setup the software needed for this class
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>
												<p>
													Launch WSL from the start menu
												</p>
												<img src = "WSLUbuntuRun.png">
											</li>
											<li>
												Set your username and password
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													Before you go too much further, you may want to enable copying and pasting from the clipboard in WSL.  Since <code>CTRL+C</code> means something special (kill a running process), copy actually happens with <code>CTRL+SHIFT+C</code>.  Likewise, paste happens with <code>CTRL+SHIFT+V</code>.  To enable these, right click on the top of the window and select 
												<p>
													<code>Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste</code>
												</p>
												<p>
													under Options->Edit Options.
												</p>
												

												<img src = "WindowsCopyPaste.png">
											</li>
											<li>
												Back in the terminal, type
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade]]></script>  
												and hit <code>ENTER</code>
											</li>
											<li>
												Next type
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													sudo apt install build-essential g++ cmake ffmpeg valgrind lldb  git libboost-all-dev libglew-dev mesa-utils libglfw3-dev openssh-server]]></script>  
												and hit <code>ENTER</code>.  This may take a moment
											</li>
										</ol>
										<p>
											Now you should have everything you need to compile C/C++/assembly programs on your computer!  There's just one more step needed to get graphical applications to work, which we will need for our pandemic simulation assignment
										</p>

										<h3><a name = "windowsgraphical">Step 3: Configure Graphical Applications</a></h3>
										<p>
											Here's how you can get graphical applications setup to run
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>In the terminal, type 

												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													echo "export DISPLAY=:0" >> ~/.bashrc]]></script> 
												<p>
													Then type 
												</p>

												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													source ~/.bashrc]]></script> 
											</li>
											<li>
												Download and install <b>vcXsrv</b> at <a href = "https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/files/latest/download">this link</a>.  This is a server for the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X Window System</a> that Linux uses.
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													Once you have installed vcXsrv, launch the program <code>XLaunch</code> from the start menu.  Select Multiple windows and click <code>Next &gt;</code>
												</p>
												<img src = "vcxsrv1.png">
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													Select "Start no client" and click <code>Next &gt;</code>
												</p>
												<img src = "vcxsrv2.png">
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													Disable Native opengl, and disable access control, then click <code>Next &gt;</code>
												</p>
												<img src = "vcxsrv3.png">
											</li>
											<li>
												Click <code>Finish</code>, and the server will be running in the background
											</li>
										</ol>

										<p>
											Congratulations, you are now finished!  You may proceed to <a href = "../Assignments/HW0_Warmup/">homework 0</a> to test everything out.
										</p>
										<p>
											<a name = "vcxsrvrestart"></a><b>NOTE: </b> You will have to quickly repeat steps 3-6 every time you restart your computer, unless you save your configuration and add vcXsrv to your startup programs.
										</p>

										<h3><a name = "wslfilepaths">A Note on File Paths under WSL v1</a></h3>
										<p>
											It's possible to go through the entire class in just the terminal, but you may want to navigate through and organize your files and folders using the ordinary Windows explorer.  Everything under your regular windows filesystem is linked to from a special place in WSL.  For instance, if my username is <code>ctralie</code> and I have a folder named <code>CS174</code> on my Desktop, then I would change into the <code>CS174</code> directory by typing 
										</p>
										<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
											cd /mnt/c/Users/ctralie/Desktop/CS174]]></script>

										<HR>
										<h2><a name = "macos">Mac OS Software Environment Instructions</a></h2>

										<p>
											Mac OS comes with considerably more support by default for Linux-like apps than Windows does, but there's still some work we'll have to do to get it ready for this class.  Below are the steps:
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Open up the terminal, and type 
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													g++]]></script> 
												<p>
													and hit <code>ENTER</code>.  If it says <code>no input files found</code>, then that atually means g++ is working!  g++ is  a program that compiles c++ files, so it needs a file as input.  The fact that it tells you that means that it's running properly.  If, on the other hand, you get <code>Command 'g++' not found</code> or you get something about an "inactive developer path," then follow <a href = "https://flaviocopes.com/fix-xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-path/">these directions</a> before proceeding.  Be patient...they may take a moment.  You should see something like this happening
												</p>


												<img src = "xcode.png">
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													If you do not already have brew, follow the directions to install it at <a href = "https://brew.sh">https://brew.sh</a>.  You should see something like this during the process:
												</p>

												<img src = "brew.png">
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													Execute the following command in the terminal
												</p>
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig]]></script>
												<p>
													This will make sure you have the permissions for brew to update package information
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													git is a "version control system" we will use to manage code in the class.  Try typing the following command in the terminal to see if you have git already
												</p>
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													git]]></script> 
												<p>
													If this command is not found, then install git with brew:
												</p>

												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													brew install git]]></script> 
												<p>
													and try again
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													Execute the following command in the terminal
												</p>
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													brew install ffmpeg]]></script> 
												(this one may take a while)
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													Execute the following command in the terminal
												</p>
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													brew install cmake]]></script> 
												<p>
													This is a special script that will help us compile complicated projects across different operating systems.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													Execute the following command in the terminal
												</p>
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													brew install glew]]></script> 
												<p>
													This is a graphics library that will help us with real time animations
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													Execute the following command in the terminal
												</p>
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													brew install glfw]]></script> 
												<p>
													This is another graphics library that will help us with real time animations
												</p>

												<p>
													<b>NOTE: </b> If you are on an M1 mac, you will need to follow the directions at <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67373307/macos-m1-fatal-error-glfw-glfw3-h-file-not-found">this post</a>
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												After all this, we also have to update our C++ compiler framework to be more recent.  Type
												
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													brew install llvm]]></script> 
												<p>
													After that's finished, note the type of terminal you're running.  If you're running zsh, then type 
												</p>
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													echo "alias g++='/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++'" >> ~/.zshrc
													echo "alias gcc='/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang'" >> ~/.zshrc]]></script> 
												<p>
													Otherwise, if you're using bash, type 
												</p>
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													echo "alias g++='/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++'" >> ~/.bash_profile
													echo "alias gcc='/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang'" >> ~/.bash_profile
													]]></script> 
												<p>
													Then, <b>close and restart</b> your terminal, and type 
												</p>
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													gcc --version
													g++ --version]]></script> 
												
												If you see <code>Homebrew clang version [...]</code>, then you're good to go.  If you still see <code>Apple clang version</code> or something similar, then the above steps failed, and you should message me or post on Discord.
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													Finally, we'll install a memory leak detector.  Execute the following two commands in the terminal
												</p>
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													brew tap LouisBrunner/valgrind
													brew install --HEAD LouisBrunner/valgrind/valgrind]]></script> 

												<p>
													<a name = "macmemoryalt">Alternative memory leak option</a>: If this doesn't work (likely on Big Sur), then don't worry...there are alternatives, as long as the last step worked.
												</p>
												

											</li>
										</ol>

										<p>
											Congratulations, you are now finished!  You may proceed to <a href = "../Assignments/HW0_Warmup/">homework 0</a> to test everything out.
										</p>

										<HR>
											<h2><a name = "virtualbox">VirtualBox</a></h2>
											<p>
												<b>NOTE: </b> This will <b>not</b> work on the newer M1 macs
											</p>
											<p>
												If you are having trouble with the above options, there is an alternative option that we can use this semester called VirtualBox.  It will let you run a Linux "container environment" from within whatever operating system you are running.  It is bulky and there's a slight performance hit, but the advantage is all of the software is already setup once you get it running, so students have really liked this option in the past.
											</p>

											<p>
												<b>Before you proceed, be sure you have 20GB of free hard drive space and are connected to the Ursinus network</b>.  Then follow the steps below
											</p>

											<ol>
												<li>
													<a href = "https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Click here</a> to download VirtualBox for your platform.
												</li>
												<li>
													<a href = "http://mathcs.ursinus.edu/virtualbox/CS174.zip">Click here</a> to download the CS 174 image for VirtualBox.  It's a 4.3 GB zip file that holds a <a href = "https://xubuntu.org/release/20-04/">XUbuntu 20.04</a> container (you will have to be on the Ursinus network).
												</li>
												<li>
													Unzip the folder you just downloaded
												</li>
												<li>
													<p>
														Open up VirtualBox and click "Add," then navigate to the folder you just unzipped and open it
													</p>

													<img src = "vboxadd.png">
												</li>
											</ol>

											<p>
												And that should be it!!  When you log in, use the following credentials
												<ul>
													<li><b>Username: </b> cs174</li>
													<li><b>Password: </b> mathcs174</li>
												</ul>
											</p>

											<p>
												Once you login, you should see a window like this
											</p>

											<img src = "vbox.png" width=800>

											<p>
												This comes with all of the packages that you need to complete <a href = "../Assignments/HW0_Warmup/">homework 0</a>, as well as Microsoft Visual Studio code for editing your files.
											</p>

											<p>
												<b>A note for Mac OS:</b> MacOS may complain about some permissions the first time you install VirtualBox.  Follow the directions to open up your security settings, clicking to unlock the settings:
											</p>

											<img src = "vboxmacpem1.png">

											<p>
												and then clicking <code>Allow...</code> and checking off <code>Oracle America, Inc.</code>
											</p>

											<img src = "vboxmacpem2.png">

											<p>
												You will then have to restart your computer and do the installation over again.
											</p>
